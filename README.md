# facebewk

facebewk is a clever little Python wrapper for the facebook Graph API. 

It is designed to minimise the number of HTTP requests, while providing a developer-friendly, dynamic representation of
data pulled from the API. 

## Getting Started

### Requirements

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then, get an API access token, create your Client object, and start querying!

[See here for an example](http://ventolin.org/2012/09/facebewk)

## Tests

````
pip install -r test_requirements.txt
nosetests
